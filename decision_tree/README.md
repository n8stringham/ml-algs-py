This directory holds code necessary to train a Decision Tree Classifier.

`DecisionTree.py` file implements the DecisionTree class while `experiments.py` builds decision trees for the Car Evaluation dataset and the Bank Marketing dataset (both from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php)).

## Running the Code
`cd` to the `decision_tree` directory and then run the script with the command
```
$ ./run.sh
```
